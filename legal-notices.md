Privacy Policy
--------------

I'm not interested in collecting your personal information. Some imprecise, high-level statistics
about visitors in general is useful, however, to help me improve the site and gauge its popuarity.

Like millions of websites around the globe, jzt.xyz uses Google Analytics to gather general statistical information about
visitor traffic. This means I will receive some information about my visitors, including you.

### What data is collected?

- The website you came from to get here.
- The length of your visit here.
- What kind of web browser and computer you're using.
- And more.

### Why do I collect this data?

The Google Analytics reports lets me know how many people are visiting, how they got here, and what pages on
this site they're looking at. Information about the web browser and computers of visitors is also included to help
me determine what kinds of new features I can support in upcoming versions of the game and website.
No personally identifiable information is included in these reports, and I can't trace any visitor activity back to you.

### Want to opt-out?

You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking through the use of [Google's Browser Add-ons][1], which supports all major
web browsers.
