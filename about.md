About JZT
---------

JZT is an homage to [ZZT][1], a DOS-era adventure game created in 1991 by Tim Sweeney of Epic Megagames.
Like its inspiration, JZT is also a game creation platform that will allow anyone to create and share JZT game worlds.
The JZT game world editor will be available shortly.

My name is Mark, and I'm a software engineer living in Montr√©al, Canada. I started working on JZT in
February, 2013 as a way to get some hands-on experience with some of the great new web technologies.
That this experiment turned into a releaseable game was a nice surprise.
