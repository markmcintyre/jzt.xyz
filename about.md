About JZT
---------

JZT is a <del>ripoff of</del> uh, I mean a <em>heavily-inspired homage</em> to [ZZT][1], a DOS-era adventure game created in 1991 by the legendary Tim Sweeney of Epic Megagames.

Like its inspiration, JZT is also a game creation platform that lets anyone to create their own JZT worlds. Unlike its inspiration, it runs in a web browser so you don't have to download or install anything. Neat!
