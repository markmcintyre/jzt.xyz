Announcing the very first release of JZT, a nostalgic, DOS-era adventure game for the web! It's a project that I've
been tinkering with on-and-off for about 19 months, so I'm pleased that it has finally reached its
[MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) state and is now available online for anyone to check out.

JZT is an homage to [ZZT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZZT), a game and
creative toolkit created by Tim Sweeney back in 1991. ZZT and its built-in scripting language ZZT-OOP was a notable
influence for me. When I decided to tinker with some of the interesting web technologies
available these days, I thought this would be a fun project to try out.

There'll be more news to come as development on the game world editor and the other games continues, but for
now check out [The Village of JZT](/worlds/village-of-jzt), the first of (hopefully)
many JZT worlds to come.
