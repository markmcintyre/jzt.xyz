It's been an especially long time since I've made an update, but here's a couple cool changes in version 1.0.55:

* JZTScript now supports a command `SendDir`, which will send a message to any JZT object in a direction instead of by object name.
* Thanks to the amazing [ZZT decompilation efforts](https://github.com/asiekierka/reconstruction-of-zzt) by GitHub user [asiekierka](https://github.com/asiekierka), the percussive sounds in JZT now sound like the original ZZT sounds.
* Due to changes in the way that Chrome and Safari process Web Audio, you now need to start JZT with a click.
* There is a new settings bar at the bottom of the gameplay area to control the full-screen and mute.

Also, work on "The Mines of JZT" is actually, seriously nearly complete. Once it is, I'll take the game and editor out of beta and do a bit more promoting of the game (which I'm admittedly pretty bad atâ€”but, hey, I'm just doing this for fun anyway. :) )
