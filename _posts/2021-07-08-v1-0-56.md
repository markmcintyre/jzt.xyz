Version 1.0.56 is now released, and it's all about scrolls!

* Scrolls now have a scrollbar (imagine that) which lets you know how far in the text you are.
* Text in the JZT scroll interface now fills the entire scroll at all times, rather than starting in the center. This is unlike the original ZZT, but makes better use of space, don't you think?
* Rather than having the selection cursor always visible, it now will only cycle between elements that are actually selectable
* The scroll 'chrome' is now a lot simpler, like a standard box.
