I'm pleased to release the first beta of the JZT Game World Editor. For those of you interested in this kind of thing, you can check out the [JZT Game World Editor](/editor) **right now**! Now, there's not a lot of instructions or help yet, and absolutely no cloud support (so you'd need to save and load files from your own computer), but I'd be happy to answer questions on the [JZT Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jzt.community).

Happy JZTing! (I _think_ that's a verb.)
