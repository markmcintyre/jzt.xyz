Version 1.0.57 is now released, and it includes some bug fixes and changes to scroll behaviour.

* Fixed inaccurate scrollbar position issue
* The cursor when selecing items in a scroll is all-new and blinky. Cool!
* Space can now be used instead of Escape to exit a scroll (since the latter would take you out of full-screen mode).

Boring, huh? ðŸ˜„
