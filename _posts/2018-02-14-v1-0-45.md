It's been a long time since I've made an update, but here's a couple cool changes in version 1.0.45:

* Were you weirded out how the game paused every time you entered a passage? Well, it doesn't happen anymore!
* Now that the game doesn't pause automatically, there's a cool new "that's all folks!" transition when you enter and exit a passage to help you find the player instead.
* The site is now secure and delivered over https, because, well, encryption is awesome and you wouldn't want hackers to spy on you and know what you're playing all day, right?

Also, work on "The Mines of JZT" is nearly complete. Once it is, I'll take the game and editor out of beta and do a bit more promoting of the game (which I'm admittedly pretty bad atâ€”but, hey, I'm just doing this for fun anyway. :) )
