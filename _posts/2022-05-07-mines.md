The Mines of JZT has been released! I told you it'd happen eventually!

There's also been a few fixes to the site:
* The social sharing function when you win or lose has been changed to copy your stats to the clipboard instead of having a button for Twitter and Facebook. Neat!
* There's been some minor stylistic tweaks to the site, bolder fonts and such.
