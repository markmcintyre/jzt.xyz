- q: Is JZT free?
  a: Yep, totally free! No ads. No personal data collection. No catches or gotchas, it's just a hobby, folks.

- q: Can I play on mobile?
  a: There are no touch controls, so if you've got a bluetooth keyboard or something for your phone, then *technically* yes? But you don't have a physical keyboard for your phone, so in another, more accurate sense, no.

- q: What browsers does JZT support?
  a: JZT should run on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.

- q: Why doesn't JZT play original ZZT worlds?
  a: Because it's not a re-creation of ZZT, just a heavily-inspired-by thing I made. It has a bunch of stuff that ZZT didn't, and doesn't have some stuff that ZZT did. If you want a 100% faithful ZZT experience, check out [asie's](https://twitter.com/cbrzeszczot) amazing [decompilation efforts](https://github.com/asiekierka/reconstruction-of-zzt).

- q: You should add X or fix Y!
  a: Yeah, I probably should! For some context, though, I started this project in **2013** so that's how fast I go. Still, drop me a line on [Mastodon](https://mstdn.ca/@markmcintyre) if you've got a bug report or feature request; slow doesn't mean abandoned!

- q: Is JZT open source?
  a: Sure is! Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/markmcintyre/jzt).
